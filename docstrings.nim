## Module docstrings
## =================
## :Author: James Boyden
## :License: MIT
## :Version: 0.1
##
## Introduction
## ------------
## This module implements Python-style docstrings that can be embedded in the
## source code of a proc, along with some simple procs and macros that enable
## those docstrings to be extracted by pragmas at compile-time.
##
## These docstrings are used for automatic extraction of introspection
## documentation from documented procs.
##
## This is an alternative to Nim's built-in double-hash documentation comments,
## since (at the time of writing) it was not possible for non-compiler code
## to extract the text from the `nnkCommentStmt
## <http://nim-lang.org/macros.html#TNimrodNodeKind>`_ nodes in the AST.
##
## The most important procs and macros provided are:
##
## 1. the `docstring` proc, which is used to declare that the string literal
##    is a docstring (using the syntax of `generalized raw string literals
##    <http://nim-lang.org/manual.html#generalized-raw-string-literals>`_)
## 2. the `extractdocstrings` macro, which is a simple example of a macro that
##    can be annotated on your docstring-containing proc `as a pragma
##    <http://nim-lang.org/manual.html#macros-as-pragmas>`_, in order to
##    extract and process docstrings
## 3. the `extractAnyDocstrings` compile-time proc, which is invoked by the
##    `extractdocstrings` pragma (or better yet, your own custom more-useful
##    pragma) to extract any docstrings in the proc
## 4. the `splitDocstringLines` compile-time proc, which you can optionally use
##    to split a sequence of long docstrings (that may well contain newlines)
##    into a sequence of single-line strings
##
## Example usage
## -------------
## This example usage code is also provided in the accompanying Nim source file
## ``testDocstrings.nim``:
##
## .. code-block:: nim
##   import docstrings
##
##   proc myProc(x: int, y: string, z: float64): int {. extractdocstrings .} =
##       ## This double-hashed comment is a Nim documentation comment:
##       ##  http://nim-lang.org/docgen.html#documentation-comments
##       ##
##       ## It's recognised by Nim's "docgen" utility, which is how the official
##       ## Nim docs are generated.  However, I can't work out how to extract the
##       ## text content of the documentation comment from my own code.
##       ##
##       ## Hence, I present extractable Python-style docstrings:
##       docstring"""This is a Python-style docstring!
##
##       It doesn't do anything by itself, but it can be extracted by pragmas like
##       the ``extractdocstrings`` pragma, enabling non-compiler/non-docgen code
##       to extract and process the text content of the docstring at compile-time.
##       """
##       echo($x, y, $z)  # just something to document...
##
##       docstring"""This is another Python-style docstring in the same proc.
##       There can be any number of docstrings amongst the top-level statements
##       of a proc.  But why would you want multiple docstrings in your proc?
##
##       Maybe you don't want a big slab of documentation right between your
##       function prototype and your function body, pushing the body way down
##       from the parameters in the prototype.  Maybe you want to document your
##       algorithm step-by-step, integrated with the code.
##       """
##
##       docstring"""The ``extractdocstrings`` pragma (or better yet, your own
##       custom pragma that invokes the ``extractAnyDocstrings`` proc, which is
##       defined in the ``docstrings`` module) will extract all docstrings.
##       """
##
##       return int(x.float64 + z)
##
##   discard myProc(1, "2", 3.0)
##
## When you compile ``testDocstrings.nim``, the docstrings will be extracted
## and printed to the console at compile-time (in the middle of the compiler
## output).

    # Since we're processing the body of the proc, we need to be ready for
    # a variety of edge-cases.  For example:
    #
    # 1. No proc body defined at all (eg, if the proc has the `importc` pragma):
    #     proc myfunc(x: int, y: float64) {. importc, extractdocstrings .}
    #    =>
    #     body = Empty
    #
    # 2. An empty proc body defined (ie, the only statement is `discard`):
    #     proc myfunc1(x: int, y: float64) {. extractdocstrings .} =
    #         discard
    #    =>
    #     body = StmtList
    #       Empty
    #       DiscardStmt
    #         Empty
    #
    # 3. An proc body defined only with a comment statement:
    #     proc myfunc1(x: int, y: float64) {. extractdocstrings .} =
    #         ## This is a comment statement.
    #    =>
    #     body = StmtList
    #       Empty
    #       CommentStmt
    #
    # More generally, if there's exactly ONE statement in the body of the proc,
    # that statement's Nimrod node will follow directly after StmtList > Empty
    # (ie, as a child of StmtList and a sibling of Empty).  But if there are
    # MULTIPLE statements in the body of the proc, they will all be contained
    # within a second INNER StmtList, that itself follows after the initial
    # StmtList > Empty.
    #
    # For example, single statement:
    #   proc myfunc1(x: int, y: float64) {. extractdocstrings .} =
    #       echo("Hello")
    #  =>
    #   body = StmtList
    #     Empty
    #     Call
    #       Sym "echo"
    #       Bracket
    #         HiddenCallConv
    #           Sym "$"
    #           StrLit Hello [User]
    #
    # versus multiple statements:
    #   proc myfunc1(x: int, y: float64) {. extractdocstrings .} =
    #       ## This is a comment statement.
    #       echo("Hello")
    #  =>
    #   body = StmtList
    #     Empty
    #     StmtList
    #       CommentStmt
    #       Call
    #         Sym "echo"
    #         Bracket
    #           HiddenCallConv
    #             Sym "$"
    #             StrLit Hello [User]
